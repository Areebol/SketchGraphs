C++ extensions for sketchgraphs
------------------------------

This folder provides some C++ extensions that sketchgraphs uses for training its models.
Note that you are not required to build these extensions, as by default pure python implementations
are also available. However, higher performance may be achieved by using these extensions for
model training.

In order to build these extensions, you will need to have a C++ compiler installed, as well as
the CUDA toolkit and compilers.
