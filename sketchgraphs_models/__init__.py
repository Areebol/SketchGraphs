"""This module contains supporting code to the main sketchgraphs dataset. In particular, it contains two models based
on graph representations of the data, which are geared towards the task of generation (see `sketchgraphs_models.graph`)
and autoconstrain (see `sketchgraphs_models.autoconstrain`). In addition, this module contains a number of submodules
to help the implementation of these models.
