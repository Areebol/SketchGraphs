# SketchGraphs: A Large-Scale Dataset for Modeling Relational Geometry in Computer-Aided Design

SketchGraphs is a dataset of 15 million sketches extracted from real-world CAD models intended to facilitate research in both ML-aided design and geometric program induction.

Each sketch is represented as a geometric constraint graph where edges denote designer-imposed geometric relationships between primitives, the nodes of the graph.
